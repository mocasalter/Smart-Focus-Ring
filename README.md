# Smart Focus Ring

Hides the CSS focus ring by default and adds a `user-is-tabbing` class to the body when a user hits the tab key. This shows a focus ring on form elements like buttons, fields, textareas and selects.

## Example

If you focus on the button via mouse, you won't see a focus outline. If you interact via keyboard, you will. ðŸŽ‰
